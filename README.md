I am a data scientist and quantitative modeller with broad experience in
central banking, IT, and academia. 

My open source project work can be found in my 
[github repository](https://github.com/paulemms). The links below show examples.

## Shiny Modules

* [ShinyBricks](http://3eeae56.online-server.cloud:3838/apps/shinyBricks/): The R package `shinyWidgets` has a shiny module to display a dependent group of 
`pickerInputs`. My module is more general since it returns a list of widgets that can be styled and it
deals with multiple selections which is harder to do in general.

## Jupyter Notebooks

* [Easy21](https://github.com/paulemms/Easy21Silver/blob/master/Easy21.ipynb) demonstrates my implementation of
the assignment on the Reinforcement Learning course at UCL given by David Silver. More information on the
problem can be found in the [source repository](https://github.com/paulemms/Easy21Silver).
* [AIMMS Tutorial](https://github.com/paulemms/LCA/blob/master/notebooks/AIMMS_Tutorial_Example.ipynb): This an example
from my [LCA](https://github.com/paulemms/LCA/wiki) application that solves a distribution problem using
linear programming.

## R Notebooks

* [Lab 9](https://paulemms.github.io/notebooks/lab9.html) is an example R notebook
demonstrating the use of my R [datamining](https://github.com/paulemms/datamining) 
package on github.
