I am a data scientist and quantitative modeller with broad experience in
central banking, IT and academia. 

My open source project work can be found in my 
[github repository](https://github.com/paulemms). The links below show some of the notebooks that
I have built as part of this work.

# Jupyter Notebooks

## MOLA

Github can view Jupyter Notebooks directly from the source repository. Here is an example from my
[LCA](https://github.com/paulemms/LCA/wiki) application.

# R Notebooks

## Datamining

This is an example R notebook demonstrating the use of the R `datamining` package on github.

Notebooks can also be viewed direct from the github source repository using the github HTML viewer
although Javascript functionality is lost.
